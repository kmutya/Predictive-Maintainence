# Predictive-Maintainence
1. Created a univariate Health Index as a function of many sensors using regression.
2. Modelled these univariate time series using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Shallow Neural Network.

This repository is the code base for this [article](https://kmutya.github.io/predmaintenance/)

*Preprocessing.R* file is used to preprocess the data and generate 100 univariate time series for each of the engines.

*Modelling.R* file contains the ARIMA and MLP models along with the forecast plots.
